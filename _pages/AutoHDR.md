# Introduction
Modern photography software like Adobe Lightroom and Darktable play a crucial role in the digital photography workflow, particularly for photographers who shoot in RAW format. RAW files contain unprocessed data directly from a camera's image sensor, preserving the highest possible quality and providing extensive flexibility for post-processing. Unlike JPEGs, which are compressed and processed in-camera, RAW files allow photographers to make significant adjustments to exposure, color balance, contrast, and other parameters without degrading image quality. This capability is essential for professional photographers and enthusiasts seeking to achieve the highest quality results.

The workflow of shooting in RAW typically begins with capturing images using a camera set to save files in the RAW format. These files are then imported into software like Lightroom or Darktable, where photographers can adjust various settings to enhance the images. The software offers a wide range of tools for fine-tuning, such as adjusting white balance, exposure, shadows, highlights, and color saturation. This non-destructive editing process means that the original RAW file remains unchanged, and all adjustments are stored as metadata. This allows for endless experimentation and refinement until the desired outcome is achieved. The RAWs themself are usually captured as neutral as possible allowing the most flexibility in edit. This however also means, that the RAWs are usually quite flat and grey, making the editing of every photo almost a necessity. 

Given the complexity and variety of adjustments available, finding the optimal settings can be a time-consuming process, especially if one edits a large set of images of an event. Therefore most photographers are deeply familiar with Lightrooms Auto Settings (Shift + A). This algorithm suggests values for some of the most important settings (Exposure, Contrast, Highlights, Shadows, Whites, Blacks, Vibrance, Saturation and some more). Most of the time these suggestions yield vibrant pictures that only need small adjustments to a subset of these settings. Therefor a usual workflow might be to apply autosettings to all images and to only retouch a subset of the settings for each image, saving a lot of time.

## HDR Photography
Since October 2023 Adobe Lightroom has added native support for high dynamic range (HDR) image editing. HDR images contain more data per pixel, allowing the image to reach higher brightness values without oversaturating shadows. An HDR compatible display will now be able to ramp up the brightness of these areas significantly, whilst still keeping the shadows dark.

You can check if your current display supports HDR by comparing the two images below. If they appear similar, then your display does not support HDR. On a proper HDR display the sun should almost be blinding and shadows should be rich in detail, just as your eye would experience it in real life.
