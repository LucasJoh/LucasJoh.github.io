I am a master student in the group of [Prof. Dr. Hans Kn√ºpfer](https://www.uni-heidelberg.de/math/knuepfer/) at the Institute of Mathematics at the Heidelberg University.

My research interests include *Partial Differential Equations* and their *Numerical Analysis*, *Calculus of Variations* and *Machine Learning*.

More precisely, in my master's thesis I analyize dynamics of second-order phase field models and the emergence of pattern formation in nonlinear systems through the application of variational techniques. I am also currently working on the implementation of a Vision Transformer based model to enable automatic HDR settings, see [AutoHDR](https://lucas-schmitt.de/AutoHDR).

I am member of the STRUCTURES Young Researchers Convent ([YRC](https://structures.uni-heidelberg.de/team.php?show_member_yrc=342)), a subgroup of the STRUCTURES Cluster of Excellence at the Heidelberg University.

I am also interested in the data-based analysis of long-term developement of young players in handball, see [handball metastats](https://lucas-schmitt.de/HBmeta).
